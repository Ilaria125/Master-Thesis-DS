##  Project Overview

This repository contains the full code and analyses developed for my Master Thesis in Data Science at the University of Barcelona. The project critically analyzes and extends the **Intelligent Therapy Assistant (ITA)** integrated into the **Guttmann NeuroPersonal Trainer (GNPT)**, with the goal of improving **personalized neuropsychological rehabilitation**.

The work includes:
- Development of **clustering models** using cognitive, demographic, and clinical features to generate patient profiles.
- Analysis and proposal of **data-driven criteria for task prioritization** aligned with individual patient needs.
- Evaluation of the revised task assignment methods to enhance the alignment between recommended tasks and patient profiles in the GNPT.
